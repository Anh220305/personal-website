      "I can't really stand this. I know it's a best seller but this is just too strong for me, I'm more of a woody/clean scent person. However, it is very long lasting and quite a mature scent. I would wear this if I'm going to a tech conference.",

    review:
      "Smells like you have money, woody, musky. I've gotten compliments every time I wear this scent both from men and women. I'm telling you, this is the one. It's not something I would repurchase since it isn't a wow enough for me to use it again and again, but its definitely an attention grabber.",
